#### About Me
I'm from Kyiv, I grew up and I live here. Recently I have started my third year of studies for my bachelorâ€™s degree in cybersecurity at Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University.
My primary and, surely, professional hobby is IT. To be clear, it's networking, cybersecurity, programming and IoT.
I always dedicate a lot of time to self-development, improving my skills, and learning something new.
And I'm sure we'll achieve our goals faster by automating some simple tasks and concentrating on the difficult ones.
