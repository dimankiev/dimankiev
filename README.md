#### About Me
My primary and, surely, professional hobby is IT. To be clear, it's networking, cybersecurity, programming and IoT.
I always dedicate a lot of time to self-development, improving my skills, and learning something new.
And I'm sure we'll achieve our goals faster by automating simple/routine tasks and concentrating on the difficult ones.
